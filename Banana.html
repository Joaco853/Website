                The Cavendish banana is te most common banana on earth.
                In global commerce in 2009, by far the most important cultivars belonged to the triploid AAA group of Musa acuminata, 
                commonly referred to as Cavendish group bananas. They accounted for the majority of banana exports, despite only 
                coming into existence in 1836. The cultivars Dwarf Cavendish and Grand Nain (Chiquita Banana) gained popularity in
                the 1950s after the previous mass-produced cultivar, Gros Michel (also an AAA group cultivar), became commercially unviable 
                due to <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_disease">Panama disease</a>, caused by the fungus
                <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusarium_oxysporum ">Fusarium oxysporum</a> which attacks the roots of the banana plant. Cavendish 
                cultivars are resistant to the Panama disease, but in 2013 there were fears that the black sigatoka fungus would in turn make Cavendish bananas unviable.
                Even though it is no longer viable for large scale cultivation, Gros Michel is not extinct and is still grown in areas where Panama disease is not found.
                Likewise, Dwarf Cavendish and Grand Nain are in no danger of extinction, but they may leave supermarket shelves 
                if disease makes it impossible to supply the global market. It is unclear if any existing cultivar can replace Cavendish bananas,
                so various hybridisation and genetic engineering programs are attempting to create a disease-resistant, mass-market banana. One such strain 
                that has emerged is the Taiwanese Cavendish, also known as the Formosana.


                The world's largest producers of bananas in 2017 were India and China, which together accounted for approximately 38% of total production.
