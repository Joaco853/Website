        <h1>Banana</h1>
        <p >    The Cavendish banana is te most common banana on earth.<br><br>
                In global commerce in 2009, by far the most important cultivars belonged to Cavendish group bananas. <br>
                The cultivars Cavendish gained popularity in the 1950s after the previous mass-produced cultivar, <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gros_Michel_banana">Gros Michel</a>, became commercially unviable 
                due to <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_disease">Panama disease</a>, caused by the fungus
                <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusarium_oxysporum ">Fusarium oxysporum</a> which attacks the roots of the banana plant. <br>
                Cavendish cultivars are resistant to the Panama disease, but in 2013 there were fears that the black <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sigatoka">Zsigatoka fungus</a> would in turn make Cavendish bananas unviable.<br><br>

                Even though it is no longer viable for large scale cultivation, Gros Michel is not extinct and is still grown in areas where Panama disease is not found.<br>
                It is unclear if any existing cultivar can replace Cavendish bananas, so various hybridisation and genetic engineering programs are attempting 
                to create a disease-resistant, mass-market banana. One such strain that has emerged is the Taiwanese Cavendish, also known as the Formosana. <br><br>

                The world's largest producers of bananas in 2017 were India and China, which together accounted for approximately 38% of total production.<br><br>

                They are originatly native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia
